Â A quarter pounder with cheese combo meal. Â This location has always been spectacularly clean (there are employees whose sole duty is just to clean all day) and never too terribly busy. Â There's also lots of seating (there's an upstairs as well) and the employees are very friendly. Â The location is great - just off Marylebone Road on Baker Street.So why only 3 stars? Â Well, it's a McDonald's. Â Not exactly known for healthy gourmet food. Â A good location though, and definitely hits the spot when I'm hurting with a hangover.",
